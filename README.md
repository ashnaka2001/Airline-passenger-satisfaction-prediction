# Airline-passenger-satisfaction-prediction
This project explores and models airline passenger satisfaction based on survey and operational data. The dataset contains 103,904 rows and 25 columns, featuring both categorical and numerical attributes related to passenger experience, demographics, and flight details.

# 📊 Project Objective
The main objective is to analyze patterns in passenger satisfaction and build predictive models to classify whether a passenger is satisfied or not. This can help airlines improve services and make data-driven decisions.The dataset consists of a column named ‘satisfaction’ which describes the overall satisfaction level of the customer. It has two values, ‘neutral or dissatisfied’ and ‘satisfied’.
